# Transcriptomic Ageing — Microarray and Proteomic Analysis
## Table of Contents
- Description
  This repository contains transcriptomic and proteomic data analysis from wild-type and galectin-3 knockout mouse microglia at different ages (6 and 24 months). The project explores how aging alters microglial function, with a focus on inflammation, synaptic regulation, and lipid metabolism, and how galectin-3 deletion modulates these processes. Results highlight galectin-3 as a key regulator of age-related neuroinflammation and a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.
- Requirements
  R version: “4.4.2.”

- [Results](#results)
  Aging induces a pro-inflammatory microglial profile and downregulates synaptic and lipid metabolism functions.
  Galectin-3 knockout partially restores synaptic remodeling and reduces pro-inflammatory gene expression.
  Proteomic analysis confirms recovery of key molecular functions and reduced lipid droplet accumulation in knockout models.
  Galectin-3 is identified as a potential therapeutic target for age-related neurodegeneration.
